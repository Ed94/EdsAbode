[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sULVoHdZfQij2yQXn_G_H97b-SGbPcs5/view?usp=sharing)

I'm a software developer with specialties in design, game development, and virtual reality. I live in Pembroke Pines, Florida and work / student @ FIU while also taking contracts. 

Currently I'm doing my degree passively while working full-time, and pursing my interests in projects with a portion of my free time.
