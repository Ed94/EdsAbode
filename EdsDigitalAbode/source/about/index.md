Software Designer, Developer

Edward Richard Gonzalez

I'm a software developer with specialties in design, game development, and virtual reality. I live in Pembroke Pines, Florida and work / student @ FIU while also taking contracts. 

Currently I'm doing my degree passively while working full-time, and pursing my interests in projects with a portion of my free time.

Check out my contacts if you want to get in touch.
