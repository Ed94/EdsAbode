                        The is the third of a series of figure/gesture studies I am doing to improve my ability at drawing people. This was done in Krita Desktop using default brush set with a color calibrated display. The fourth will be another drawing sketch like the first two.

                        This is my first time coloring a black and white image. I used only a color HSV layer.

                        The B&W variation can be found here.
