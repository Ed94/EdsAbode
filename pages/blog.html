            This is the first post since creating this website. I've been wanting to create a personal hub from sratch; learning html and the other various tid bits for programming/designing a website as I go. In the future, I plan to post here various things I do or occur in my life. These include updates for this site, projects I'm doing, or stuff I create in general. <br/><br/>
            
            Before I put up new posts however, I'll be posting some stuff that has occured before I made this site. I'll have these below this post. <br/><br/>
                
            For this inital version of this site, I'll be saving an archived version of it to look back on in the future. If your intrested in seeing what this page originally looked like it will be accessible as a link in this post.

            Went to my first hackathon. It was similar to the Global Game Jam. We were given roughly 60 hours to make something. This was probably the best thing that happend in my spring semester at FIU. There was a bunch of energy, activity, and plenty of people to meet and have fun with.<br/><br/>
            
            Since I had never gone to one of these before I brough evertyhing I had that would be useful, this included, my laptop, desktop, a bunch of gamepads, the destkop, bluetooth speaker, headphones, and an HTC Vive. At the entrance most of the sponsors had booths and discussed with us with State Farm asking us to fill out a survey, and IBM was giving out a Rasphberry PI 3. I picked one of those up quickly as the supply was going to run dry soon.<br/><br/>
            
            After registering myself, I went to look at the space the hackathon had reserved. It was essentially the entire first floor of PG6 at FIU. The louge area kept its same purpose, while the rest of the lecture rooms were used as spaces for formed teams to work on their individual projects. The only exception being the small lecture room used as a quiet area and some of the computer labs used for workshops they would have throughout the hackathon. After around 20 minutes I found three people looking for a group and was able to team up with them. We then setup in 112 as it had the most empty space and we would need it for VR.<br/><br/>
                
            After the opening ceremony, we went on to brainstorm what we were going to do with VR. Initial plans were to spew out fractals from the vive's controllers be soon realized the fractals formula's may be to complex for the amount of time we had. Then we decided to do a sort of shooting gallery with the player and enemies flying around in space. From there we devised our roles on the project. I was in charge of figuring out a proper way of doing locomotion to fly through space. while retianing control. We unanimously decided to use unity to work on VR, as we were exposed to it earlier at the Unity workshop from UPE and it was easy to implement VR with. <br/><br/>
                
            Near the end of the night, I met a guy named Matthew who asked if he could share the VR space for his own project he was working on since I already had one setup. He lent us his tripods aswell so we didn't need to keep our bootleg setup for keeping the base stations up. His project was on getting a sort of earth bending expereince working, where the player could manipulate brown blocks. He with another guy named Haczar, I also found out they were involved in OpenHid, and that the HTC vive they brought was from the lab.<br/><br/>
                
            Nearly half way through I had figured out a good locomotion VR involving the player producing a ray from the controller into the direction in virual space they wanted to travel. After the ray is placed out, all they need to do is press the trigger and the motion's velcoity gets translated to acceleration toward the direction of their choosing. To change their position all they would need to do is shoot out a new ray in the direction of their choosing. While I had the concept down, getting it to work in unity proved to be a challenge as I was not familiar with its libraries or objects used to handle VR. While the ray seemed to working, amd I was getting a velocity from the controllers when pressing the trigger I could not get it to change cammera's position in the virutal space. My teammates had also been fatigued after getting the weapon projectile properly working, and attempting to build a proper level and enemy AI. After saturday night they were not willing to continue in the event. I decided to keep going over night to see if I could at least get the locomotion working. Unfortunately even with the aid of various addons that make VR easier and getting quite close by using some prewritten code from example scenes, I was not able to get the locomotion working before the end of the event.<br/><br/>
                
            In the end the event was still a blast and met a ton of great people! I'll be finishing the locomotion some time in the future as well.

            I found out about OpenHid through my FIU email recently and decided to sign up for when of their research studies as a participant. I found out they are a human interaction design lab. While there they had me do various gestures multiple times on a all-in-one pc with a touch screen. While there I noticed they also had an HTC Vive laying around.</p>

            During the first meeting at UPE that I attended, they discussed a sort of 'hackathon' for video games called a game jam." As someone already making a game in their free time I was naturally intrested to I signed myself up for the event. Essentially we had a bit less than 72 hours to make a video game based on a theme announced during the opening ceremony for the event.<br/><br/>
                
            I was able to quickly team up with a group. We at first decided to do a top down game where a character navigates using echo location, avoiding enemies as they go. We then scrapped that half way through and went with 3D horror where red radar waves scan through the entire maps's models to give player's a sense of where they are while they run away from various enemies they encounter as they traverse through the map. If they are able to avoid all the enemies and get through they win. If they get touched by a single enemy they lose.<br/><br/>
                
            We were able to finish the game on time and during the showcase, the game became quite popular for its natural suspense created by the lighting effect and the lack of awareness of enemy position. Other teams also had great games, one created a game where the player was a monkey looking for a key, while making a mess at a company office. Another was a bat flying through a cave with similar wave lights to our game, a platformer where the enviornment moves based on the music being played.
                
            During awards, people voted ours as best overall experience and we won a game making book, Level Up Game Design!
