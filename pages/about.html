            <p>A student at Florida International University, working toward B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
            
            <h3>Me: </h3>
        
            <p>A tech enthusiast who likes anything to do with computers, audio, displays, virtual reality, cameras, racing simulation. I've played video games for an unnatural amount of time, like to make a mess with digital art, and am getting into making myself a game. When I get the chance I love changing it up and doing different things around my area and hope to visit many places of the world. I also have a thing for music and driving; occasionally playing with a guitar or making some tunes on a daw, or talking/watching about cars.</p>
